v1
Prediction: Every time the user clicks, there is a popup alert
Observations: Every time I click on a specific name in the table, there
is a popup alert of the name that is clicked on.

v2
Prediction: Every time the user clicks, the names pop in order from left to right
Observations: Every time I click, the name pops up, then the alert changes
to the html of the table of the selected row, then the whole table

v3
Prediction: It will have the same nature as v2, except it will pop up once the user opens the page
Observations: Instead of showing the name first, it shows the html of the table as a whole
then the name, then the row

v4
Prediction: Since everything is true, I am not sure what will get priority when clicked.
Observations: It goes from the table html to row html to the name. When e.stopPropagation()
is uncommentted, only the table html shows. So order doesn't matter.
